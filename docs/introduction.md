# Introduction

Our project focuses on automating documentation as part of a DevOps workflow.

### Why automate documentation?
- It keeps docs up to date automatically.
- It removes manual steps from the development process.
- It ensures consistency whenever the codebase changes.

### What tools are we using?
- **MkDocs** for building a clean static documentation site.
- **GitHub Actions** for automated builds and deployments.
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting the site.

This project demonstrates how documentation can integrate smoothly into CI/CD pipelines.
